</h3>

<p>Dear developers, contributors, and friends of Enigma,<br>
  <br>
  today we finally release Enigma 1.30. You can find some information and all files
  <a href="https://github.com/Enigma-Game/Enigma/releases/tag/1.30">here on GitHub</a>.
  For more detailes and install instructions, please also look out for
  Enigma 1.30 in our <a href="$$download$$">download section</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Many thanks to the whole team!
</p>

<p>In Enigam 1.30 we added several new translations (Bosnian, Chinese,
  Japanese, Norwegian, and Slovene). This release brings some entirely new
  game play objects as well:
  <i>forward floors</i>, <i>glass marble</i>, <i>st_inkwell</i>, <i>st_portal_glass</i>,
  <i>st_document</i> and <i>st_pebble</i>, leading to new types of puzzles and riddles.
  On top of that we added 116 new main-pack levels where you may encounter some of these
  new objects.
  (Enigma now consist of a total of 1100 main-pack levels, plus 22 tutorials, 1119 sokoballs,
  95 pentominoes, 268 dejavus, and 2 training levels; altogether 2606.)<br>
  <br>
  On the technical side, we added support for additional graphics tilesets and
  enable unconstrained resizing of the application window.
  The middle mouse button can now be customized, too.<br>
  <br>
  Internal changes include the long overdue switch from SDL version 1.2 to 2.0.
  We use <i>tinygettext</i> instead of <i>gettext</i> for our internationalization
  demands.
</p>

<p>Have a fun summer</p>

<p>Andreas, Daniel, Sidney, Raoul, Nobby, Thomas, and Georg</p>
